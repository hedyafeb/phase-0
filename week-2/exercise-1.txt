1. NEWTON SECOND LAW
	Pseudocode:
		STORE "mass" with 600.
		STORE  "acceleration" with 2
		CALCULATE "mass" times "acceleration"
		SET "force" value with calculation result
		DISPLAY "force"



2. TAHUN KABISAT:
	Algorithm:
		1. Set a year
		2. Check if year is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, then display as "it is a leap year"
		3. Check if year is divisible by 4, 100, and 400, then display as "it is a leap year"
		4. Other than that, display as "it is NOT a leap year"

	Pseudocode:
		STORE "year" with any value
		IF "year" modulo 4 equal 0 AND "year" modulo 100 not equal 0
			DISPLAY "It is a leap year"
		ELSE IF "year" modulo 4 equal 0 AND "year" modulo 100 equal 0 AND "year" modulo 400 equal 0
			DISPLAY "It is a leap year"
		ELSE
			DISPLAY "It is NOT a leap year"
		ENDIF



3. LAUNDRY DAY:
	Algorithm:
		1. Washing machine is empty
		2. Put 1 laundry to washing machine
		3. If laundry is less than 20, repeat step 2
		4. If laundry equal 20, turn on washing machine

	Pseudocode:
		STORE "totalLaundry" to 0
		WHILE "totalLaundry" less than 20
			ADD 1 to "totalLaundry"
			DISPLAY "totalLaundry"
			IF "totalLaundry" less than 20,
				DISPLAY "Washing machine is still off"
			ELSE IF "totalLaundry" is 20,
				DISPLAY "Washing machine will be turned on"
			ENDIF
		ENDWHILE



4. PERIKSA KUKU:
	Algorithm:
		1. Check student's nail
			2. If nail is long, then punish the student
			3. If nail is short, then praise the student
		4. Repeat step number 1 for all other students (repeat 40 times)

	Pseudocode:
		FOR every 40 student's nail
			IF nail is long
				DISPLAY "punish student!"
			ELSE
				DISPLAY "praise student!"
			ENDIF
		ENDFOR
